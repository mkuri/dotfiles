"""Record Antigravity CLI (`agy`) session state for status display consumers.

Registered as an antigravity lifecycle hook (hooks.json). Reads one hook event
JSON from stdin, receives the event name as argv[1], and maintains one state
file per session at $XDG_STATE_HOME/antigravity-sessions/<id>.json via the
shared session_state helper. The schema is the same versioned contract the
Claude producer writes, consumed by display tools such as agent-status-bar.

Only PreInvocation -> running and Stop -> idle are handled. PostToolUse is
deliberately NOT hooked: live testing showed a trailing PostToolUse fires
AFTER Stop for a turn, which would reset the state back to running and the
session would never settle to idle.

Antigravity requires every hook to emit a JSON object on stdout; this monitor
always prints `{}` and never alters the agent's behavior (it does not hook
PreToolUse). Must never break or slow `agy`: always exits 0.
